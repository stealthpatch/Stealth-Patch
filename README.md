## The Impossible Patch

- Perk animation is vanilla.
- Audio does not double.

### Changes
- Better box RNG (Both setup & trades).
- Better drop RNG.
- Jug first from the monkeys.
- Fixed all issues caused by game_mod.

### How to install
- Step 1: Extract the `game_mod.zip` folder to your Black Ops folder.
- Step 2: Drop the patch in your `zone/Common` folder. No need to back up your `common_zombie_patch.ff`, this is an entirely new file.
- Step 3: Open BO1 with `BO_Mods.bat`.
- Step 4: Rename `zone/Common/frontend_patch.ff` to `!frontend_patch.ff` to remove all modifications in the settings menu.
- Step 5: Have fun ofc, not our fault if you get caught using it.
